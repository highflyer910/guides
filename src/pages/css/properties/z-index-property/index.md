The **z-index** property is used to set the element's stacking order that overlap. It only works on positioned elements (anything apart of *static*).

If multiple elements overlap then the value of this property is used to determine which one is displayed on top.

Without any z-index value elements stack in the order that they appear in the DOM.

##### CSS Syntax
```
z-index: auto|number|initial|inherit;
```
**auto** - The stack order is 0. This is default.

**inherit** - The *inherit* keyword is used to specify that the value for this property should be taken from its parent element.
